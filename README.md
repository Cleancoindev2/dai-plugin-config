Dai Config Plugin
</h1>

### Development

This plugin takes a testchain ID and retrives a `Maker` configuration object. When used with Dai.js as a plugin, the configuration will be used to create a new `Maker` instance.

This POC uses a mocked backend to generate a config object.

## Code Style

We run Prettier on-commit, which means you can write code in whatever style you want and it will be automatically formatted according to the common style when you run `git commit`.

### License

The dai config plugin is [MIT licensed](./LICENSE).
